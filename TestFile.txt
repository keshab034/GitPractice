This is first test file and named as TestFile1.txt

This file is cloned from remote repository to local repository.
I made this change form my local repository through GitBash.

This edition is done on file of local repository. This file was pulled from remote repository and pushed to remote repository after edit. But, now I edit this additional code in the file of local repository. After aditi I again pushed it to remote repository. I delete the last line and added this line. This is considered as code.
